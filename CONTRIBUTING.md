# Contributing

## Workflow
- Default branch: main
- Use feature branches for all changes
- Open a pull request for every change; no direct pushes to main

## Commit Style
- Use Conventional Commits:
  - feat:
  - fix:
  - chore:
  - docs:

## Quality Expectations
- Keep changes scoped to a single purpose
- Update documentation when behavior changes
- Prefer small, reviewable pull requests
